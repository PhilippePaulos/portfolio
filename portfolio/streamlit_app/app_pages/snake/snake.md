# Snake AI Duel

This project showcases an interactive Snake game where two agents compete to collect food in the shortest time while avoiding collisions. Each agent is controlled by a different AI model, which follows strategies provided by the user.

## Game Objective:
- The snake moves around the grid, collecting food while avoiding its own body.
- Each food collected increases the snake's length and score.

## How It Works:
1. **Choose an Agent:** Select the AI model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`) to control each snake.
2. **Customize the Strategy:** Add your own prompt or strategy to guide the agents' behavior. For example, instruct them to prioritize safety or minimize the path to food.
3. **Start the Game:** Watch as the two agents compete to outscore each other, using the strategies you’ve defined.

## Features:
- **AI Customization:** Each agent's behavior is powered by an AI model, which can learn strategies provided by the user.
- **Real-Time Gameplay:** Observe the agents’ moves in real time on separate game boards.
- **Scoring:** The snake grows longer with each piece of food collected, and the score increases accordingly.
